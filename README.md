Smart Service Assistant 🤖

An AI-powered, responsive chatbot designed to deliver seamless customer support and improve service quality.
Built with Flask (back-end), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (front-end), and NLP (Hugging Face Transformers), this project demonstrates how UX-driven design and AI integration can enhance user satisfaction, retention, and trust.
